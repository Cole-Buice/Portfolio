# Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in data analytics, encompassing projects from various courses and personal explorations.

## Skills & Experience
- **Skills**: Proficient in SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and spreadsheets.
- **Courses**: Completed Google Data Analytics & Advanced Data Analytics certificates on Coursera, as well as Udacity's SQL for Data Analytics course.
- **Experience**: Worked on diverse analytics tasksâ€”basic data analysis, visualizations, and advanced techniques like machine learning model design.

## Projects
- [CapStoneAdvancedAnalytics.ipynb]: This was the final project for my advanced analytics course.
  The goal was to use machine learning to determine the predictability of employees likely to leave the company and use the findings to boost employee retention.
  Three models were developed using logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost methods.
  Logistic regression did not perform well enough to be considered reliable, but both random forest and XGBoost models performed with incredibly high predictive power.
  
- [Primes]: Prime numbers have always fascinated me and I like to use them as a way to practice my programming skills.
  In this project I constructed an advanced version of sieve of Eratosthenes to assemble a dataframe of numbers and if they are prime or not.
  A function was added to extract a numbers location on an ulam spiral using purely mathmatics rather than using if else instructions.
  This was to practice my math and critical/creative thinking skills.
  Additional functions were added to further extract information about the numbers such as its number of digits, first and last digit, and more.
  The numbers were plotted on an ulam spiral and then color coded to observe trends for different extracted variables.
  Additional plots were constructed to examine trends in different formats.
  The numbers ulam coordinates required the use of triangular numbers to be extracted from the number.
  This led me to the idea of using tetrahedral numbers to extract 3 dimensional coordinates and observe the trends of primes in a 3D plot.
  After this exploratory analysis and data collection the data was reduced to its variables that would only be attainable without any knowledge of which numbers are prime or not.
  The reemaining data was then used to develop predictive models. Using logistic regression, random forests, and XGBoost models I attempted to predict if a number was prime or not.
  As expected predicting primes is difficult and the created models were not reliable though they were more successful than anticipated.
